# Evaluation results

Each run records the date, the revisions of the skill, cases, and scorer, the agent and model, the
prepared case revisions, and the score. Scores come from `python3 -m tools.evals score`.

## 2026-10-16 — Run 1

- Skill `1f172b0` (unchanged through `b2e7c04`), cases `b2e7c04`, scored with `d3e61c6`.
- Agents: one fresh Claude Code general-purpose subagent per case, with the skill copied outside
  this repository so the expected findings were not readable. The model was inherited from the
  coordinating session (Opus 5.5); the subagents' model was not independently verified.
- Prepared revisions: python-service `c67d66d`, typescript-cli `7f27a08`, well-maintained `8ca9f29`.

| Case | Seeded gaps found | False flags | IDs covered | Findings | Meets | Not applicable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| python-service | 16 of 16 | CI-09 | 69 of 69 | 46 | 1 | 22 |
| typescript-cli | 13 of 13 | none | 69 of 69 | 40 | 5 | 24 |
| well-maintained | 2 of 2 | REPO-01 | 69 of 69 | 8 | 26 | 35 |

Notes:

- The scorer first reported 24 typescript-cli IDs as uncovered because the report listed them as
  indented bullets. `d3e61c6` reads that form; the table uses the corrected score.
- REPO-01 in well-maintained was a correct finding: the case documented `python`, which stock
  Ubuntu does not provide. The same audit found an undocumented transliteration defect. Both were
  case errors, fixed in `80adb0a`.
- CI-09 in python-service exposed an ambiguous rule for criteria that depend on unreadable hosted
  settings, clarified in `d8876be`.
- Whether the audits left the prepared repositories unmodified was not checked in this run.

## 2026-10-16 — Run 2

- Skill `d8876be`, cases `80adb0a`, scored with `d3e61c6`.
- Agents: three new Claude Code general-purpose subagents with the same prompt and isolation as
  run 1. The model was inherited from the coordinating session (Opus 5.5) and not independently
  verified.
- Prepared revisions: python-service `c67d66d`, typescript-cli `7f27a08`, well-maintained `6578802`.

| Case | Seeded gaps found | False flags | IDs covered | Findings | Meets | Not applicable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| python-service | 16 of 16 | none | 69 of 69 | 39 | 1 | 29 |
| typescript-cli | 13 of 13 | none | 69 of 69 | 38 | 5 | 26 |
| well-maintained | 2 of 2 | none | 69 of 69 | 7 | 25 | 37 |

Notes:

- After each audit, `git status --porcelain --ignored` was empty and HEAD was unchanged in every
  prepared repository.
- CI-09 in python-service is now not applicable, citing the missing `merge_group` trigger.
- The audits also reported real defects that were not seeded: typescript-cli splits quoted CSV
  fields and overwrites its input by default (ARCH-02), and the well-maintained README still says
  accented Latin letters become their base letter, while the code drops letters such as Ł, Đ, Ø,
  and ß (REPO-06, confirmed with `unicodedata`). The well-maintained defect remains in the case;
  fixing it or adding it to `must_find` requires another run.
- Two runs of three cases measure these seeded defects only. They do not establish recall on real
  repositories or with other agents and models.
